# CS 5008 - Khoury College of Computer Sciences

This organization acts as a central repository for various CS 5008:  Data Structures, Algorithms, and Their Applications within Computer Systems sections. 


## Course Description
This course presents an integrated approach to the study of data structures, algorithms, and their applications within computer systems. We introduce a variety of systems-related topics (models of computation, computer architecture, compilation, system software) and fundamental techniques for solving algorithms (divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, graph algorithms) as they apply to computer systems. The integration of topics is demonstrated through the implementation of fundamental data structures (lists, queues, trees, maps, graphs) in the C programming language. Additional breadth topics can include programming applications that expose students to primitives of different subsystems such as multi-threading.

## Prerequisites
The course is suitable for students in good standing in the ALIGN MS in CS program that have successfully completed CS 5002 and CS 5001.

## Course Objectives 
By the end of this course, students should be able to:

1. Explain the basic terminology of computer systems, various models of computation and the role of the operating system as a resource manager.
2. Demonstrate a working knowledge of using a terminal to navigate the operating system; gather system information; and compile, execute and, debug C programs
3. Describe each step in the compilation process for the C programming language.
4. Analyze assembly code and explain its relationship to C code, the fetch/execute cycle, and basic system architecture.
5. Implement common data structures in the C programming language (e.g., lists, trees, graphs) as well as commonly used algorithms that operate on these structures using dynamically allocated memory.
6. Compare and contrast different algorithmic approaches to a problem (e.g., searching, sorting, scheduling).
7. Describe specific algorithmic strategies and how each can be used to solve problems.
8. Analyze the computation and storage complexity of algorithms by employing the substitution method, the Master theorem, and recursion trees.
9. Explain proofs related to algorithm correctness and write a simple proof using loop invariants.
